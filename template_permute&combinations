We can use following template to solve Permutations and combination problems

function helper(subproblem, partial solution){
    if(subProblem.size==0) { // base case for leaf worker
	   print partial solution or append to global list
	  
	  }
	  else
    { // recursive code internal node
	    for each choice c1, c2, c3, .... cK
		     filling the left most blank
	       ie add that into partial solution and Delegate
		     Delegate -> helper(slightly smaller subproblem, slightly larger partial solution)
	  }
function overall(problem size n) :
   intialize globalResult;
   helper(fullproblemsize, blankslate)
   return result


Permutations Vs combinations:

  in permutations , order matters but in combinations there is no need of order
  lets take an example with 3 array elements [A,B,C] if we want to select 2 elements out of 3  what are different choices
   [A B] [B C] [A C]  --> combinations
   [A B] [B A] [B C] [C B] [A C] [C A] --> permutations --> 3!
